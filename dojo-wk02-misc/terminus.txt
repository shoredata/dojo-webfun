Assignment: MIT Terminus
By now you are all terminal command/command prompt pros (okay, well you are on the road to being one at least). As you have now seen, terminal commands are a great tool for being able to traverse your system to create, read, update, and destroy information as you want. Well some bright minds at MIT decided to take this one step further and make these commands into a game they call "Terminus".  Utilizing the commands for a Linux system you can become an intrepid explorer traversing and interacting with a world of fantasy and fun!

Welcome! If you are new to the game, here are some tips:

Look at your surroundings with the command "ls".
Move to a new location with the command "cd LOCATION"
You can backtrack with the command "cd ..".
Interact with things in the world with the command "less ITEM"

If you forget where you are, type "pwd"

Go ahead, explore. We hope you enjoy what you find. Do ls as your first command.
