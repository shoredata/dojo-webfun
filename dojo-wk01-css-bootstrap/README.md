Bootstrap

Objectives

Get familiar with Bootstrap, a very popular css library/framework used by lots of developers

As developers, you'll most likely use an existing CSS file created by others.  
This is a good opportunity for you to know how it's like to leverage another css framework that's created by other folks.
For you to appreciate the simple design that Bootstrap provides.


What is Bootstrap?
In the words of its creators, bootstrap is a "sleek, intuitive, and powerful mobile-first front-end framework for faster and easier web development."

To use Bootstrap, first put the following lines in the <head> section of your file:

<!-- Latest compiled and minified CSS -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha384-BVYiiSIFeK1dGmJRAkycuHAHRg32OmUcww7on3RYdg4Va+PmSTsz/K68vbdEjh4u" crossorigin="anonymous"> 
<!-- Optional theme --> 
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap-theme.min.css" integrity="sha384-rHyoN1iRsVXV4nD0JutlnGaslCJuC7uwjduW9SVrLvRYooPp2bWYgmgJQIXwl/Sp" crossorigin="anonymous">
<!-- jQuery -->
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.min.js" integrity="sha256-FgpCb/KJQlLNfOu91ta32o/NMZxltwRo8QtmkMRdAu8=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
<!-- Latest compiled and minified JavaScript --> 
<script src="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/js/bootstrap.min.js" integrity="sha384-Tc5IQib027qvyjSMfHjOMaLkfuWVxZxUPnCJA7l2mCWNIpG9mGCD8wGNIcPD7Txa" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>


Now you can go ahead and  add Bootstrap classes to your HTML elements in order to easily achieve consistent, clean, and responsive design.



Assignment - what to learn first
Create a simple website using the following elements of Bootstrap:

Part I:
Documentation and examples:  http://getbootstrap.com/css/

Grid system (for positioning and sizing of elements):

container  
row  
col-md-4  
col-md-offset-2

Text alignment:

text-left  
text-center  
text-right

Text colors:

text-primary  
text-success  
text-danger

Tables:

table  
table-striped  
table-hover

Buttons:

btn  
btn-default  
btn-primary  
btn-success

As you haven't learned jQuery yet, please do not worry about any javascript portion of Bootstrap, which is basically anything that does something when you click on a specific HTML element (e.g. dropdown button, etc).  Just focus on how to make the html elements look good.

Do not spend more than 3 hours learning Bootstrap. There are many other features within Bootstrap, but you can learn them later, perhaps when you build your first project.
