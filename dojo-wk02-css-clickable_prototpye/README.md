Project Clickable Prototype
====================

If you're already done with all the algorithm challenges and have experimented with both Bootstrap and Foundation, then you can get a head start on your project by building your first clickable prototype.

Overview
-----------

What is a clickable prototype?

Before any product is built, it's highly recommended for the team to first build out a wireframe and then build out the website in plain html, css, and javascript first.  This first version of the website, without any backend, is called a clickable prototype.  Later when you learn Python and Django, you'll learn how to add the backend functionalities but it's important to always have this clickable prototype built first and then add the backend functionalities rather than building out the html and css while building out the backend.

What Clickable Prototype to Work on

Please either work on the e-commerce system, User Dashboard, or employee clock in/out system (see below for the PDF wireframes)
If you have another project idea to work on, please sketch it out on the whiteboard/paper, use Balsamiq or Powerpoint to layout how your website would look like and get your instructor to look at your wireframe and give you feedback.

Extra Challenge
------------------

Go ahead and make the first few pages of your web page responsive.  This will be good experience for you and also impress those that look at your project.
